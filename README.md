# 🌐 Translator

A powerful and modular Neural Machine Translation (NMT) system built completely from scratch using the **Transformer architecture**. This project demonstrates how deep learning and attention mechanisms can be applied to translate text between human languages.
It is the part of MINOR PROJECT , Computer Engineering , 3rd year, IOE Pulchowk.

## 🧠 Architecture Overview

This project is inspired by the groundbreaking paper:  
📄 *"Attention Is All You Need"* – Vaswani et al., 2017

It implements the following components:

- **Encoder**: Processes the source sentence
- **Decoder**: Generates the target sentence
- **Multi-head Scaled Dot-Product Attention**
- **Feed-Forward Networks**
- **Layer Normalization**
- **Positional Encoding**

The entire architecture is built using only core Python libraries and PyTorch.
